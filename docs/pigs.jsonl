{"prompt":"Pigs are very clean animals ->","completion":" Despite my mother consistently calling my bedroom a pigsty growing up, pigs are actually very clean animals. In fact, they’re some of the cleanest animals around and refuse to defecate where they sleep and eat if given the choice. Even newborn piglets will leave their sleeping areas to relieve themselves!###"}
{"prompt":"Pigs can’t sweat ->","completion":" 'Sweating like a pig' is another misleading and commonly used phrase since pigs can’t sweat! Pigs don’t have many sweat glands, so they roll around and sleep in mud and swim in water to keep cool. A bonus to rolling in mud: it helps keep a pig’s skin from getting sunburned.###"}
{"prompt":"Pigs are smarter than your dog ->","completion":" It’s true! Pigs have the intelligence of a human toddler and are ranked as the fifth most intelligent animal in the world! In fact, pigs are more intelligent and trainable than any breed of dog. They learn their names in just two weeks and come when they’re called. Pigs are even capable of playing video games better than some primates.###"}
